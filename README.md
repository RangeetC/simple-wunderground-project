# simple-wunderground-project

NOTE: This project is now obsolete due to Wunderground significantly changing their API.
They no longer allow you to use their API unless you pay. I will leave this project for posterity.

A simple project using the Wunderground API to write some details about the current weather(current when the program is launched) into csv files.
